# 🧪 learning-lab

Welcome to **learning-lab** — a curated personal sandbox for algorithm practice, language exploration, and system-level experimentation. This repository serves as a central archive of LeetCode problem solutions, language-specific experiments, and foundational code patterns across **C/C++**, **Java**, **Kotlin**, and **Rust**.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository is not a tutorial or teaching resource for others but rather a **learning journal** and **technical sandbox** for:

* Solving LeetCode and competitive programming problems
* Exploring multiple programming paradigms
* Practicing language features and low-level constructs
* Recording common patterns, caveats, and optimizations
* Experimenting with ideas before using them in production or larger projects

## 🏗️ How to Use

> *You can clone and explore any folder independently. Each folder is language-scoped and may contain LeetCode problem IDs, topic-based subfolders, or custom test cases.*

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TikTzuki/learning-lab.git
cd learning-lab
```

### Compile examples (C++ example):

```bash
cd cpp/101-symmetric-tree
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

> You’ll find comments or `README.md` files in some subdirectories explaining edge cases, performance, or language-specific insights.
